            When my son Tobey was diagnosed with dyslexia, we struggled to find resources that truly understood his unique way of learning. At school, he was falling behind his peers, despite having an incredibly creative mind.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            As an AI researcher, I began developing a specialized tutoring platform—a system that would adapt to dyslexic thinking patterns. I knew that Tobey wasn't lacking intelligence; he simply processed information differently than traditional education methods allowed for.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The breakthrough came when Tobey discovered dinosaurs. His passion for paleontology was unmatched—he could recall complex species names, geological periods, and evolutionary traits that most adults would struggle to memorize. We incorporated this interest into our AI tutor, and suddenly, learning became exciting for him.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            By recognizing that dyslexia isn't merely a disability but a different cognitive approach, we created Tobey's Tutor. The platform leverages the strengths of neurodivergent thinking while providing adaptive support for traditional academic challenges.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-8">
            Today, Tobey has not only caught up with his peers but excels in many subjects. His experience inspired us to help other children discover their unique potential, turning learning differences into powerful advantages.
