            We created Tobey's Tutor as a practical solution for our son Tobey—a bright 11-year-old with dyslexia who inspired both our mission and our name.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Like many parents of children with learning differences, we searched for effective tools to support his education. Seeing his natural curiosity about superheroes, dinosaurs, and YouTube's Mark Rober, we developed a tutoring system that connects learning to his genuine interests.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            By thoughtfully integrating his passions into structured learning sessions, we've created a tool that makes academic progress both effective and engaging—leading Tobey to voluntarily ask for study time.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            While no technology replaces great teachers and schools, Tobey's Tutor offers what we couldn't find elsewhere: a personalized learning experience that meets children where they are—addressing specific needs, building confidence, and making education feel relevant to their world.
